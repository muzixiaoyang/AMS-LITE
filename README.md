Welcome to the MZ-AMS-LITE Github page!

The project aims to bring multi-material capabilities to 3D printers using multiple direct-drive tool heads. While this project is primarily used for VORON printers, it can also be used (or adapted) on any 3D printer running Klipper, and possibly for RRF.

Did you like the project? Do you want to support me and my work and help me bring new cool stuff to the community? Well, you can tip me here
